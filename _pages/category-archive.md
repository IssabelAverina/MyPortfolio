### Personal Projects
- A [Vehicle Classifier](https://github.com/IssabelAverina/PersonalProjects/tree/d5b05946aff38fe14782d18aeecd39d305a1d5b7/VehicleClassifier) that could identify 17 different vehicle types. The model was able to predict the vehicle type with a 95% accuracy after minimal tuning. This result was achieved by using transfer learning on a CNN that is trained on resnet34.
