### [Personal Projects](https://github.com/IssabelAverina/PersonalProjects/tree/main)
- A [Vehicle Classifier](https://github.com/IssabelAverina/PersonalProjects/tree/d5b05946aff38fe14782d18aeecd39d305a1d5b7/VehicleClassifier) that could identify 17 different vehicle types. The model was able to predict the vehicle type with a 95% accuracy after minimal tuning. This result was achieved by using transfer learning on a CNN that is trained on resnet34.
- [Flights Price Prediction](https://github.com/IssabelAverina/PersonalProjects/tree/main/FlightsPricePrediction): A project made to estimate the cost of airline tickets using machine learning based on various features like departure date, airline, duration, number of stops, and more. Accurate predictions can help users make informed decisions when booking flights and assist travel platforms in offering personalized pricing suggestions.
- [Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/IssabelAverina/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Book%20Recommendation):  A content-based book recommendation system built using FAISS for vector search and Ollama's nomic-embed-text model for generating semantic embeddings. The goal is to recommend similar books based on a given book. Ollama is used to generate text embeddings for each book, I selected this embedding model because it is lightweight and optimized for efficiency, making it ideal for running on my laptopâ€™s hardware. Unlike larger models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) that requires payments and high-end GPUs.
